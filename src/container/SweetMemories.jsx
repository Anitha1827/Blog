        ðŸ˜¦ Iâ€™m really missing her... Every night Iâ€™m crying like anything. I was
        still hoping she would consider me... but I donâ€™t know whether I should
        wait for her or what to do... Tears...
        <br />
        <br />
        But I understand, she will be happy without me, and I should not disturb
        that. ðŸ™‚ ðŸ˜¥
        <br />
        I hope she is happyâ€¦ praying to God that she gets everything she wants.
        <br />
        <br />
        To be continuedâ€¦
