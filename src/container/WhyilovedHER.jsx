        Why i loved HER !!

        Year 2014. I was going to computer lab for getting my record getting
        signed.She was standing in corner ( cute 🙂 ). My lab staff scolded me
        badly,seeing that she was laughing at me. It was my first eye to eye
        contact.
        <br />
        <br />
        Months passed. We had PHP class getting started off and she was in that
        team. She and myself was put into team for building a website design. I
        was keep on making her to work. At one time she got tired. And i loved
        the way she use to work.
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>❤️ She doesn’t get tensed or afraid.</li>
          <li>❤️ Bold and Beautiful.</li>
          <li>❤️ Trustworthy and sincere god believer</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        She doesn’t speak through her lips.. but thru her beautiful eyes. It may
        be anger or tension, and this is what first made me to notice her.
        <br />
        I cant speak with her directly eye to eye. i have attend alot of public
        stages or symposiums.. But cant even spell a word seeing her 🙂

        i like,she also liked it..
