      <p class="description">
        Year 2014. I was going to the computer lab to get my record signed. She
        was standing in the corner (cute 🙂). My lab staff scolded me badly,
        seeing that she was laughing at me. It was my first eye-to-eye contact.
        <br />
        <br />
        Months passed. We had a PHP class getting started off and she was in
        that team. She and I were put into a team for building a website design.
        I kept making her work. At one time she got tired. And I loved the way
        she used to work.
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>❤️ She doesn’t get tensed or afraid.</li>
          <li>❤️ Bold and Beautiful.</li>
          <li>❤️ Trustworthy and sincere God believer.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        She doesn’t speak through her lips but through her beautiful eyes. It
        may be anger or tension, and this is what first made me notice her.
        <br />
        I can’t speak with her directly eye-to-eye. I have attended a lot of
        public stages or symposiums, but can’t even spell a word seeing her 🙂

        We were just messaging rarely but had a few things in common. The songs
        I like, she also liked.
