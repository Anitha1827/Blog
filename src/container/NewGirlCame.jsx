        Had a few conversations with Princess. As always, even a DOT coming from
        Princess is precious for me. Actually, I used to wait for days to get
        any message from her. I had selected a special notification tone for my
        princess’s messages (Sneham Charum song).
        <br />
        Very high pressure from my relations to get married. They chose a girl
        and asked my decision to marry her.
        <br />
        I met that girl in person. I told my past (I didn’t mention my
        princess’s name). She laughed. She said, “You haven’t taken her out, and
        you’re saying you love her?”
        <br />
        <br />
        She was 23. She thinks that loving a person means taking that girl out,
        taking pictures, going on a bike. I rejected her, saying that I’m an
        old, outdated person. She left happily.
        <br />
        As I said earlier, I don’t know how to send romantic messages, I don’t
        know how to talk to a girl, but I can say one thing: my love is as true
        as my affection towards my parents. It’s pure. I might have failed in
        expressing that.
        <br />
        My friends left me. Many people started to talk very badly about me,
        getting aged (my age 31). So what?
        <br />
        I am happy with the memories. They’re precious to me.
