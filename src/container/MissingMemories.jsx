        Two days more for Feb 14! ðŸ˜¦ Valentineâ€™s day ðŸ˜¥ The same year I proposed
        her. Canâ€™t forget the chats before Feb 14... ðŸ˜¥ Missing you badly... So
        badly...
        <br />
        <br />
        Even though people see as if I am OK, but actually I cry inside every
        second. Because I loved her like anything.
        <br />
        Still... I thank God that she didnâ€™t choose me. Because she deserves a
        better person than me.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have no doubt that GOD will give her the BEST MAN as a life partner
        and she will be happy always... This thought is the only thing keeping
        me going.
        <br />
        Closing WhatsApp and Facebook ðŸ˜¦ Because daily, once I get up, I see her
        DP on Facebook... Since she asked me to delete her NUMBER, I donâ€™t have
        her WhatsApp... But her number is by heart to me.
