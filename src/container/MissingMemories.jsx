        Two days more for Feb14! ðŸ˜¦ Valentineâ€™s day ðŸ˜¥ The same year i proposed
        her. Cant forget the chats before the feb 14.. ðŸ˜¥ Missing u badly.. So
        badly..
        <br />
        <br />
        Even though people see as if i am OK,but actually i cry inside every
        second. Bcoz i loved her like anything.
        <br />
        Still.. i thank god that she didnâ€™t chose me. Bcoz, She deserve better
        person than me.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have no doubt that GOD will give her the BEST MAN to her as life
        partner and she will be happy always.. This line only making me to
        survive.
        <br />
        Closing Whatsapp and Facebook ðŸ˜¦ Bcoz, daily once i get up, i will see
        her DP in facebook.. Since she asked me to delete her NUMBER, i dont
        have her watsapp.. But her number is by-heart to me.
