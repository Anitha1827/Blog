        She got married to a handsome person. I was very happy. at last she
        married to a person who belong to her religion. ( even though was in
        tears )

        <br />
        Love is not being getting married . living for one person is love. I
        decided to do something big for her birthday . i planned to adopt a
        homeless girl education on behalf of her.
