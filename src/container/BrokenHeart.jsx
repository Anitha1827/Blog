        Its been few days.. No chat in watsapp.. sometimes in facebook.. Due to
        some abroad calls, i am forced to use watsapp and facebook.. On that
        occasions i just message her good night,good morning and so on.. But
        still i fell i should not message her.. Becoz.. i just want to become
        good earning person and then i should talk to her..
        <br />
        <br />
        Many people may feel its not good to do for a girl you love.. That is..
        Not messaging her or caring her.. But what i feel is, If in case if she
        say ‚Äù YES ‚Äù to my love, i should be in position to lead the life.. Buy
        watever she ask for.. likes for.. So.. I am waiting for my time..
        <br />
        <br />
        But daily, i see her previous messages.. SWEET,PRECIOUS,BEAUTIFUL
        MOMENTS THOSE!!! Mostly we start fight with ‚Äù Can i ask you a question ‚Äù
