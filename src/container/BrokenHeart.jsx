    It‚Äôs been a few days.. No chat on WhatsApp.. sometimes on Facebook.. Due to
    some abroad calls, I am forced to use WhatsApp and Facebook.. On those
    occasions, I just message her good night, good morning, and so on.. But
    still, I feel I should not message her.. Because.. I just want to become
    a good-earning person and then I should talk to her..
    <br />
    <br />
    Many people may feel it‚Äôs not good to do this for a girl you love.. That is..
    Not messaging her or caring for her.. But what I feel is, if in case she
    says ‚ÄúYES‚Äù to my love, I should be in a position to lead the life.. Buy
    whatever she asks for.. likes for.. So.. I am waiting for my time..
    <br />
    <br />
    But daily, I see her previous messages.. SWEET, PRECIOUS, BEAUTIFUL
    MOMENTS THOSE!!! Mostly we start a fight with ‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù üôÇ
    <br />
