        She accidentally pressed the VIDEO CALL button in watsapp to my number,
        I got a missed call.
        <br />
        She then messaged,”sorry wrongly pressed”
        <br />
        But i didn’t reply for the msg. Becoz, if i reply , i fear there will be
        little conversation starts. I dont want that. Im trying best to forget
        her.
        <br />
        But daily i pray to god for her. Not that she need to get love with me!
        Thats selfish!!
        <br />
        She needs to get THE BEST man in this world as her life partner. Not lyk
        me, who is unable to chat with a girl, being lyk robot 😦
        <br />
        And best part is, the wishes i prayed to god, is not failed so far. So
        she will definitely have the most colorful life than any other girl.:) &
        there lies my happinezz.
        <br />
        To see her happy always & nothing else. 🙂 🙂
