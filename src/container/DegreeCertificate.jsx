        Heart beat was tharu maru.. How can i say “NO” ?
        <br />
        What i did was a first forgery work. I created a New Gmail in the name
        of Princess, sent a Mail to college Principal, and messaged as ”
        Respected Principal, Hand over my certificate to S*****, Its a
        Educational Emergency “.
        <br />
        After sending the mail, went to college, got the certificate from
        principal.
        <br />
        After getting certificates, i told her i will come directly and give to
        you
        <br />
        She was in some other plan,hence i went to Pujapuura ( sweet 12hrs
        journey ). I went inside her college, and messaged her that i had
        arrived.

        <br />
        She asked me
        <h1 className="font-bold text-red-600">
          “HAND OVER THE CERTIFICATE TO THE NEAR BY JUICE SHOP “.
        </h1>
        <br />
        Without questioning or asking why, i hand over the certificate and took
        the bus. Many people would have got angry, but i dono, may be its my
        manufacturing fault, im not getting anger on her. I feel bad only if i
        force her for something, which i have not did so far.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dear GOD, Please arrange a accident to me.. and i need to lost
        everything.. Coma stage 🙂 .
        <br />
        Day by day, im losing myself.. Forgot to mention, in that certificate, i
        had enclosed an blank cheque to her, mentioning in that” If in
        emergency,please use it “
        <br />
        <br />I accept that, im not good in speaking or texting to girls.. But ,
        acting like someone is cheating na..we have to be ourself.. But being
        you, u cant succeed in love..Lyk Me 😦

        Heart Broken into pieces… 😥 Felt lyk killed.. She never used to speak
        like this.. But i dono what mistake i made again..
        <br />
        My little hope ( i still had hope to marry her with her family support
        ), lost!! I told to myself, “Its over Completely ” “Its over Completely
        “
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">November 16,2016</h1>
        <br />I was thinking.. thinking.. thinking..about my(sorry 😦 ), not
        mine, princess of Ka*****…
        <br />
        I was thinking these..
        <br />
        1.OK. She don’t have “PREMAM” towards me.. Hence what next? I cant
        forget her. If i need to marry someone, i should say that i already
        loved a sweet person & cant forget her…So are u ok? Surely,the girl will
        say “NO” .. And i am a kind of person who wont lie.. God, what can i
        do..?
        <br />
        2.Consider i commit suicide..Best way to forget her… But .. God had sent
        me in this world for a reason, if i commit suicide ,i am dis-obeying him
        😦
