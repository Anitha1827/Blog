    Two days before, she messaged me this 🙂

    Heart beat was tharu maru.. How can I say “NO”?
    <br />
    What I did was a first forgery work. I created a new Gmail in the name
    of Princess, sent an email to the college Principal, and messaged as ”
    Respected Principal, Hand over my certificate to S*****, It’s an
    Educational Emergency “.
    <br />
    After sending the email, I went to the college, and got the certificate from
    the principal.
    <br />
    After getting the certificate, I told her I would come directly and give it to
    you.
    <br />
    She was in some other plan; hence, I went to Pujapuura (sweet 12hrs
    journey). I went inside her college and messaged her that I had
    arrived.

    I don’t know what happened, she texted me this,
    <br />

    <br />
    She asked me
    <h1 className="font-bold text-red-600">
      “HAND OVER THE CERTIFICATE TO THE NEARBY JUICE SHOP”.
    </h1>
    <br />
    Without questioning or asking why, I handed over the certificate and took
    the bus. Many people would have gotten angry, but I don’t, maybe it’s my
    manufacturing fault; I’m not getting angry at her. I feel bad only if I
    force her to do something, which I haven’t done so far.
    <br />
    <br />
    Dear GOD, Please arrange an accident for me.. and I need to lose
    everything.. Coma stage 🙂 .
    <br />
    Day by day, I’m losing myself.. Forgot to mention, in that certificate, I
    had enclosed a blank cheque to her, mentioning in that, “If in
    emergency, please use it.”
    <br />
    <br />I accept that I’m not good at speaking or texting to girls.. But,
    acting like someone else is cheating, right? We have to be ourselves.. But
    being you, you can’t succeed in love.. Like Me 😦

    <br />
    Heart Broken into pieces… 😥 Felt like I was killed.. She never used to speak
    like this.. But I don’t know what mistake I made again..
    <br />
    My little hope (I still had hope to marry her with her family support)
    is lost!! I told myself, “It’s over Completely” “It’s over Completely”
    <br />

    <br />
    I was thinking.. thinking.. thinking.. about my (sorry 😦 ), not
    mine, the princess of Ka*****…
    <br />
    I was thinking these..
    <br />
    1. OK. She doesn’t have “PREMAM” towards me.. Hence what next? I can’t
    forget her. If I need to marry someone, I should say that I already
    loved a sweet person & can’t forget her… So are you okay? Surely, the girl will
    say “NO” .. And I am a kind of person who won’t lie.. God, what can I
    do..?
    <br />
    2. Consider I commit suicide.. Best way to forget her… But .. God has sent
    me into this world for a reason, if I commit suicide, I am disobeying Him 😦
