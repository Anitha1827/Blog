        Three important things went.
        <ul>
          <li>ðŸŽ‰ NEW YEAR</li>
          <li>ðŸ’‘ Her Marraige Anniversary</li>
          <li>ðŸ’• Valentines Day</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        New year, i went to her place. Drunk, Drived, Cried.. I messaged her.
        She kept status for me( once i saw it, she will delete it ).
        <br />
        Marraige Anniversay! Usual celebration. But, lot happened inbetween.
        After new year, i decided to block her. Since i cant able to stop
        feelings. The instance i think of her, i start to kerala. it becomes a
        habbit. Selfishly i keep on praying to meet her atleast once. Since she
        didnt gave permission, i cant able to. So i asked her to block me or can
        i block. She said NO!

        <br />
        For the first time, i didnt listen to her. i was feeling harsh. i
        blocked.
        <br />
        <br />
        Days gone by, i got a normal message from regarding website doubt. Got
        to know she is not well and having fever, and in hospital. I immediatly
        unblocked her in whatsapp, contacted my cousin who is a doctor, and
        asked her influential to do extra care in the hospital where princess
        there.

        <br />
        <br />
        After a day, again i asked her, that i will block and blocked.
        <br />
        People may think, im kind of lunatic or stupid enough of this block and
        unblock. Truth is, im very delicate for her. i dont want any problem to
        be faced by her from my end. at the same time, if anything she needs, i
        need to help her the maximum. struck between these two edges.
        <br />
        Its been month, no communication. No normal message. No Mail. Nothing..
        Life goes.
        <br />
        <br />
        After my relations, from my business end, my clients started to ask
        about my marraige. Can solve or stop by my relations end. But, same cant
        be done with clients. They ask me out of affection on me.
        <br />
        <br />
        The stand on marriage still the same. I cant be true to the girl, in the
        sense, princess memories will be always there. Hiding or acting like
        showing love wont withstand. I dont want the mistake do by all others in
        this regard. Even at one instance princess asked me to get married.
        <br />
