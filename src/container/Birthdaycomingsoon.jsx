      Three important things went.
      <ul>
        <li>ðŸŽ‰ NEW YEAR</li>
        <li>ðŸ’‘ Her Marriage Anniversary</li>
        <li>ðŸ’• Valentine`s Day</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      New year, I went to her place. Drunk, Drove, Cried.. I messaged her.
      She kept a status for me (once I saw it, she would delete it).
      <br />
      Marriage Anniversary! Usual celebration. But, a lot happened in between.
      After the new year, I decided to block her since I couldnâ€™t stop my
      feelings. The moment I think of her, I start to go to Kerala. It becomes a
      habit. Selfishly I keep on praying to meet her at least once. Since she
      didn`t give permission, I couldnâ€™t do it. So I asked her to block me or
      if I could block her. She said NO!
      <br />

        alt="chat"
        className="image"
      />
      <br />
      <br />
      For the first time, I didnâ€™t listen to her. I was feeling harsh. I
      blocked her.
      <br />
      <br />
      Days went by, and I got a normal message from her regarding a website
      doubt. Got to know she was not well and had a fever, and was in the
      hospital. I immediately unblocked her on WhatsApp, contacted my cousin
      who is a doctor, and asked her to do extra care in the hospital where
      the princess was.

        height={600}
        className="image"
      />
      <br />
      <br />
      After a day, I again asked her that I would block her and did it.
      <br />
      People may think I`m kind of a lunatic or stupid with this block and
      unblock. The truth is, I`m very delicate about her. I donâ€™t want her to
      face any problems because of me. At the same time, if she needs anything,
      I need to help her to the maximum. Stuck between these two edges.
      <br />
      Itâ€™s been a month, no communication. No normal messages. No mail. Nothing..
      Life goes on.
      <br />
      <br />
      After my relations, from my business end, my clients started to ask
      about my marriage. I can solve or stop the questions from my relations,
      but the same canâ€™t be done with clients. They ask out of affection for me.
      <br />
      <br />
      My stand on marriage is still the same. I canâ€™t be true to any girl, in
      the sense that the princessâ€™s memories will always be there. Hiding or
      acting like showing love wonâ€™t withstand. I donâ€™t want to make the same
      mistake others do in this regard. Even at one instance, the princess asked
      me to get married.
