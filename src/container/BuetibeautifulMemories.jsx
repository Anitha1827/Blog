        Where can i start? So many beautiful things happened in between Sept
        2022 ‚Äì Nov 2022.
        <br />
        1st, i asked her the reason why she didnt like me ? or interest to marry
        me?Finally i got the reason. Reason is = ME
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        She too had love towards me. i failed to understand her messages. i
        failed to understand what she tried to say. i was the STUPID PERSON of
        the century. Losser. I was a ROBOT, MACHINE. Waste Machine.
        <br />
        That day is unforgettable. i was crying.. crying.. crying for the whole
        day. Imagine, you are the reason to miss a angel in your life. That PAIN
        is more severe than DEATH. I was literally think‚Äôd of suicide. i even
        planned to erase my mobile, FB etc , and write death note as ‚Äù Due to
        Business loss, i commit suicide, no one responsible‚Äù
        <br />
        Had 3 to 4 Beer and took my car.. I dono where to go? What to do? Just
        tears, extreme sadness, hatred towards myself. I sent a 3 voice note
        asking SORRY to her. Whats else i can do?
        <br />
        Days passed. i just PAUSED my suicide. Two Reasons,
        <ul>
          <li>üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Parents</li>
          <li>‚ù§Ô∏è My princess may still require any help</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        Days passed. She asked me to teach Web design class. i agreed, Evening 3
        to 4PM, for one hour, for 7 days, i teached her what all i know. (
        During the class, i hav never ever asked anything about other that
        website ). Sweet days. actually i got addicted to that. When there is no
        class due to any work for her, i would feel sad..
        <br />
        <br />
        She trained. ( i think so ), She will be, bcoz, She is the most
        intelligent angel.
        <br />
        After Training completed, WE decided to start a company for her.
        <br />
        <br />
        Days passed.
        <br />I decided to go to her city (Kerala). Actually i had a temple
        visit near by, but my heart said, JUST GO. i went at morning, driving
        crazy like anything, as if i am going to see my wife/lover after many
        years

        <br />
        <br />
        Reached there. i just finally breathed the AIR which my princess
        breathe. i walked to the streets, where she would have walked with her
        beautiful feet.
        <br />
        <br />
        In tanglish, ( If u want tell something from heart, use tanglish, said
        by myprincess )
        <br />
        <br />
        Avanga ooruku vanden.. avanga swachicha kaatra, naanum swacchen, avanga
        alagu kaalagal nandha idathil, naanum nanden..
        <br />
        Avanga enge ellam shopping poirpangu nu guess pani, anga ponen.. KSRTC
        Bus stand ponen..
        <br />
        Slowly, Slowly i realized, From ROBOT, i was changing to HUMAN.
        <br />
        My anger reduced.. My loving of Songs increased ( Megam Karukuda ‚Äì
        Thiruchidrambalam movie).
        <br />
        <br />
        Usually, i wont listen to anirudh songs. my choice of songs will be
        different ( actually no one listen those songs)
        <br />
        <br />
        I was staying for a DAY. One mind asked me to call.. Other mind said,
        dont call idiot. She is married happily.
        <br />
        Love wont make someone into trouble. it should be supportive. So, i
        didnt call her.
        <br />
        With Heavy heart, i left her town.. Again, went returning, Tears, Megam
        karukuda song + bear.
        <br />
        <br />
        Days passed,
        <br />
        <br />
        Sometimes, i cant control my feelings, i was undergoing a small surgery.
        so i didnt use my mobile for a week.
        <br />
        Meanwhile she messaged me, Her Husband and Sweet kid got fever. she went
        to hospital. I always pray every time if i go to temple. This time, i
        went to a special temple and did Archani. I told temple pusari, to do
        special archanai for her family ( Told her name, her hus and her kid ).
        I was happy that they will recover, bcoz, that temple is were i prayed,
        she should get good husband ( not like me who is like tupelight, fool,
        dont understand message, dont know to type ).
        <br />
        <br />
        I went to surgery, 3 days i was not using mobile. Hard days. My Love was
        increased heavily towards her ( ya, i know i cant do anhthing about it,
        But yet.. )
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        After 3 days, i messaged her. i was literally like hugging her tightly,
        and say, ‚Äù I miss you so much than anything ‚Äú.
        <br />
        BUT, i didnt msg like that. i was very strict officer na, i gave some
        home work on website training, like a maths teacher, i was asking ‚Äù
        Where is your assignment ‚Äù ?
        <br />
        Days passed,
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">NOV 11, 2022</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        She asked me not to Message further. YES. Again, i was asked not message
        further. i said YES.
        <br />
        Still Registration of her company is pending. i didnt ask anything about
        that. i completely stopped messaging.
        <br />
        Not putting any whatsapp status.. Not sending Good Morning or Good Night
        Messages.. Nothing.
        <br />
        A orphan KID always know that he/she dont have parents, even someone
        take them temporarily. They wont feel sad. Becoz they are used to. Like
        that, i know my happiness wont last. BUT, i thought from my princess
        position.
        <br />
        <br />
        She have a family.
        <br />
        <br />
        She needs to cook.
        <br />
        <br />
        She needs to take care of her husband
        <br />
        <br />
        She needs to see her KID
        <br />
        <br />
        She needs to take care of her aunt/uncle
        <br />
        <br />
        Shopping/Cleaning/etc..
        <br />
        <br />
        How many work/thinking my princess go through daily, comparing her, my
        MISSING is not so heavy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold text-orange-600">In Tanglish,</h1>
        <br />
        Avanga daily evlo work paakuranga, + avanga feelings um control panitu,

        avanga feelings marandu, same pressure life handle pannranga, atha
        compare panrappa, ennaku irukkara feelings oru vishyama illa. Sorry
        <br />I just feel sad sometimes..
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold text-orange-600">In Tanglish,</h1>
        <br />

        avangalku life la eppovume SADNESS or ivana poi marraige panitome nu
        feel panama paatukuven.. but, ellam pochi.
        <br />
        Before she asked me to stop sending messages, i called her one noon.
        YES.. I called. With week of training on how to speak without fear, i
        called her, and said from college days to my proposal, my love, why i
        failed to understand, everything.. Call was about, 30 mins, she didnt
        said anything.
        <br />
        That was my LAST CONTACT with her. I decided not to Message, No status,
        No DP.. Nothing. Eagerly waiting for her marraige anniversary
        celebration
        <br />
        <br />
        To be continued‚Ä¶ Love you üò¶
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">NOV 16 2022</h1>
        Its been 5 days.. My deeply stressed worrying about her. First of all,
        Who am i worry about her? This question further hurting me alot. So, i
        did a crazy thing. Since i didnt msg her, also she, i thought of filling
        this gap.
        <br />
        I had 2 sim cards. Second Sim mobile number, i saved as ‚Äù Yen uyire‚Äù (
        that is princess ), and created second whatsapp.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now!!!
        <br />
        <br />I myself send ‚Äù How are you? ‚Äù msg from my 1st Number to 2nd
        Number.
        <br />
        From my Second number, again, myself will reply like ‚Äù I am Fine ‚Äù üò¶

        <br />
        <br />
        i know this look stupid. But, it somehow helped me to little bit reduce
        by depression.. Just little bit. Every bit of princess style of message
        is know to me.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">22 NOV 22 1:10AM</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        Princess lastly told me, ‚Äù Next time if u want to BLOCK in Whatsapp,
        inform before doing ‚Äú..
        <br />
        But.. Today i had dream of her again. This time, i cant write here. It
        was a long dream.
        <br />
        I use to keep on checking her DP.. She used to keep a mountain pic,
        lastly a beach side pic..
        <br />
        I cant able to control my feelings further. It wont be good. Hence, with
        heavy heart, i decided to BLOCK in whatsapp.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold text-orange-600">In Tanglish,</h1>

        inform panamlye BLOCK panuren..
        <br />
        <br />
        Blocked in Whatsapp. Not in LIFE.. Not in my Breath.. Not in my MIND.
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">NOV 25 4:00AM</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        Sat infront of my god idol in my room. Silently cried.. cried like
        anything.. i unblocked her whatsapp to check, what DP she kept. Its
        empty. she too blocked.
        <br />
        My prayers are now changed. I just prayed to END my life. In a way, i
        questioned god, Why Should i deserve this pain? What karma i did? I have
        never think bad for others. Cant able to sleep from day she said not to
        message. Per day, im sleeping at 5AM, waking at 8AM.
        <br />
        Sometimes i pray for any chance will she come again? Any hope of
        marraige again? I was ready to marry her if in case if she having any
        marraige problems in her life, and that if she come out legally.
        <br />
        I know this thinking is stupid and not practical. I have two options
        now. Either i need to end myself ( i now forgot what will my parents
        will suffer), or any chance will she come back.
        <br />
        Second option is HIGHLY not practical. She said she is happy with
        marraige life.
        <br />
        So, First option. Anyone who reading this, Please Dont LOVE a person who
        can‚Äôt marry them. True Love. Every day, Every second is poison.. U cant
        SLEEP, EAT, SMILE, Do nothing.. Every second, She will come to your
        mind.
        <br />
        struck in that. The pain i undergo is so deep in the sense, all the
        temple i go, i am praying for my death.. No other wish.
        <br />
        After a long time, i have taken a strong decision. Either i need her or
        please close my breath.
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold"> FUN FACT</span>: Even i get died, for
        certain days, i think my AAVI, SOUL ‚ò∫Ô∏è will go to kerala.. Will try to
        help her problem what she told earlier.
        <br />
        <br />
        Going to Kodaikanal today, for my favourite temple. To pray for my
        closure. It feels happy to pray like this. Not like, i need money, job
        etc
        <br />
