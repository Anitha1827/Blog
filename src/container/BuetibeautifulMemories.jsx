        Where can I start? So many beautiful things happened between Sept 2022 ‚Äì
        Nov 2022.
        <br />
        1st, I asked her the reason why she didn‚Äôt like me or was interested in
        marrying me. Finally, I got the reason. The reason is = ME
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        She too had love towards me. I failed to understand her messages. I was
        the STUPID PERSON of the century. Loser. I was a ROBOT, MACHINE. Waste
        Machine.
        <br />
        That day is unforgettable. I was crying, crying, crying the whole day.
        Imagine being the reason to miss an angel in your life. That PAIN is
        more severe than DEATH. I was literally thinking of suicide. I even
        planned to erase my mobile, FB, etc., and write a death note saying,
        ‚ÄúDue to business loss, I commit suicide, no one is responsible.‚Äù
        <br />
        Had 3 to 4 beers and took my car. I didn‚Äôt know where to go or what to
        do. Just tears, extreme sadness, hatred towards myself. I sent 3 voice
        notes asking SORRY to her. What else can I do?
        <br />
        Days passed. I just PAUSED my suicide. Two reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Parents</li>
          <li>‚ù§Ô∏è My princess may still require any help</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        Days passed. She asked me to teach a Web design class. I agreed, from 3
        to 4 PM, for one hour, for 7 days, I taught her what all I know. (During
        the class, I never asked anything about other than the website). Sweet
        days. Actually, I got addicted to that. When there was no class due to
        any work for her, I would feel sad..
        <br />
        <br />
        She trained. (I think so), She will be, because she is the most
        intelligent angel.
        <br />
        After training was completed, WE decided to start a company for her.
        <br />
        <br />
        Days passed.
        <br />
        I decided to go to her city (Kerala). Actually, I had a temple visit
        nearby, but my heart said, JUST GO. I went in the morning, driving like
        crazy, as if I was going to see my wife/lover after many years.

          height={600}
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        Reached there. I finally breathed the AIR that my princess breathed. I
        walked the streets where she would have walked with her beautiful feet.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Tanglish, (If you want to tell something from the heart, use
        Tanglish, said by my princess)
        <br />
        <br />
        Avanga ooruku vanden.. avanga swachicha kaatra, naanum swacchen, avanga
        alagu kaalagal nandha idathil, naanum nanden.. Avanga enge ellam
        shopping poirpangu nu guess pani, anga ponen.. KSRTC Bus stand ponen..
        Slowly, I realized, From ROBOT, I was changing to HUMAN. My anger
        reduced.. My love for songs increased (Megam Karukuda ‚Äì
        Thiruchitrambalam movie).
        <br />
        <br />
        Usually, I won‚Äôt listen to Anirudh songs. My choice of songs is
        different (actually no one listens to those songs).
        <br />
        <br />
        I stayed for a DAY. One mind asked me to call. The other mind said,
        don‚Äôt call idiot. She is happily married. Love shouldn‚Äôt cause trouble.
        It should be supportive. So, I didn‚Äôt call her.
        <br />
        With a heavy heart, I left her town.. Again, while returning, tears,
        Megam Karukuda song + beer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Days passed,
        <br />
        <br />
        Sometimes, I couldn‚Äôt control my feelings, and I was undergoing a small
        surgery. So, I didn‚Äôt use my mobile for a week.
        <br />
        Meanwhile, she messaged me. Her husband and sweet kid got a fever. She
        went to the hospital. I always pray every time I go to the temple. This
        time, I went to a special temple and did Archani. I told the temple
        priest to do special archanai for her family (I told her name, her
        husband, and her kid). I was happy that they will recover because that
        temple is where I prayed she would get a good husband (not like me who
        is like a tube light, fool, doesn‚Äôt understand messages, and doesn‚Äôt
        know how to type).
        <br />
        <br />
        I went for surgery. For 3 days, I wasn‚Äôt using my mobile. Hard days. My
        love for her increased heavily (yeah, I know I can‚Äôt do anything about
        it, but yet..)
        <br />

        />
        <br />
        <br />
        After 3 days, I messaged her. I was literally hugging her tightly, and
        saying, ‚Äô‚ÄôI miss you so much more than anything.‚Äô‚Äô
        <br />
        BUT, I didn‚Äôt message like that. I was a very strict officer. I gave
        some homework on website training, like a math teacher, asking, ‚Äô‚ÄôWhere
        is your assignment?‚Äô‚Äô
        <br />
        Days passed,
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="highlighted-date">NOV 11, 2022</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        She asked me not to message further. YES. Again, I was asked not to
        message further. I said YES.
        <br />
        Still, the registration of her company is pending. I didn‚Äôt ask anything
        about that. I completely stopped messaging.
        <br />
        Not putting any WhatsApp status. Not sending Good Morning or Good Night
        messages. Nothing.
        <br />
        An orphan KID always knows that he/she doesn‚Äôt have parents, even if
        someone takes them temporarily. They won‚Äôt feel sad because they are
        used to it. Like that, I know my happiness won‚Äôt last. BUT, I thought
        from my princess‚Äôs perspective.
        <br />
        <br />
        She has a family.
        <br />
        <br />
        She needs to cook.
        <br />
        <br />
        She needs to take care of her husband.
        <br />
        <br />
        She needs to see her KID.
        <br />
        <br />
        She needs to take care of her aunt/uncle.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shopping/Cleaning/etc..
        <br />
        <br />
        How much work/thinking my princess goes through daily, compared to her,
        my MISSING is not so heavy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="highlighted-orange">In Tanglish,</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        Avanga daily evlo work paakuranga, + avanga feelings um control panitu,
        life la ethachum achieve pannanum nu think pani, but oru situation la,
        avanga feelings marandu, same pressure life handle pannranga, atha
        compare panrappa, ennaku irukkara feelings oru vishyama illa. Sorry
        <br />I just feel sad sometimes..
        <br />
        <h1 className="highlighted-orange">In Tanglish,</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        Naa avangala kalyanam panirthana, avangala princess madhiri paathirpen..
        avangalku life la eppovume SADNESS or ivana poi marraige panitome nu
        feel panama paatukuven.. but, ellam pochi.
        <br />
        Before she asked me to stop sending messages, I called her one noon.
        YES.. I called. With a week of training on how to speak without fear, I
        called her and said from college days to my proposal, my love, why I
        failed to understand, everything.. The call lasted about 30 mins, she
        didn‚Äôt say anything.
        <br />
        That was my LAST CONTACT with her. I decided not to mess up.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="highlighted-date">NOV 16, 2022</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        After a few days, I received a call, I still remember it, I was walking
        through streets, watching shopping, etc., at my nearby temple. I was
        getting a call from an unknown number. I didn‚Äôt pick up. Because I had
        already written on paper, (one day I will get a call from my princess. I
        will answer her call then and discuss everything). I was waiting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Later, I found out that the call was from her number. I was happy. I
        waited for a call.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the meantime, I was sad. I knew that my princess was in pain, but I
        was thinking about her pain and her situation.
        <br />
        <br />
        I didn‚Äôt tell her about my pain.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, I have an answer. The only thing I can do is be there in her mind
        as a nice person.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am happy that my princess, even if I am not there, still remembers me
        as a good person and someone who can help if needed. I never expected
        anything more.
        <br />
        <br />
