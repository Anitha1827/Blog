        Its been 1 day, No whatsapp message from her. I really got hurt, she
        used to ask me ‚Äù Had supper ?‚Äù, ‚Äù Had dinner etc ‚Äú.. But none today üò¶ i
        really missed those caring messaging from her. No one cares me like
        that.

        I kept her profile pic as my profile in watsapp ! Not that to hurt or
        anything. Bcoz she needed me as a friend. But i was disliking that
        relationship ( how can i ?), so to make her comfortable,i decided to
        make her dp which says ( friend is friend forever ) about friendship. So
        inorder to make her happy,i kept that. I AM SORRY GIRL üò¶

        <br />
        She asked me not to quit watsapp, but i said if i keep on chatting with
        you, my affection on you get increase day by day. And she told,she is
        not loving me anymore, one day or other,she will get married to someone.
        If suddenly i stop texting her on that day onwards, how can i live ? üò•
        <br />
        <br />
        But if she feels happy only on texting me on watsapp,ill do.. i said to
        her i wont delete the watsapp.
