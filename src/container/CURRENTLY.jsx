      Itâ€™s been 1 day, No WhatsApp message from her. I really got hurt; she
      used to ask me, â€™â€™Had supper?â€™â€™, â€™â€™Had dinner?â€™â€™, etc. But none today ðŸ˜¦ I
      really missed those caring messages from her. No one cares for me like
      that.

      <h1 className="font-bold">APRIL 29, 2016 11:45PM</h1>

      I kept her profile pic as my profile on WhatsApp! Not to hurt or
      anything. Because she needed me as a friend. But I was disliking that
      relationship (how can I?), so to make her comfortable, I decided to
      make her DP say â€™â€™friend is friend foreverâ€™â€™ about friendship. So
      in order to make her happy, I kept that. I AM SORRY GIRL ðŸ˜¦

      She asked me not to quit WhatsApp, but I said if I keep on chatting with
      you, my affection for you will increase day by day. And she told me
      she is not loving me anymore; one day or another, she will get married
      to someone. If suddenly I stop texting her on that day onwards, how
      can I live? ðŸ˜¥
      <br />
      <br />
      But if she feels happy only on texting me on WhatsApp, Iâ€™ll do it.. I
      said to her I wonâ€™t delete WhatsApp.
