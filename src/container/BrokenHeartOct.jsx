      <br />I used to send good morning, good night messages to her. I can only
      send thoseâ€¦ Because, I donâ€™t know what to speak even though a lot of
      things are running in my mind.
      <br /><br />
      Likewise, I messaged her, â€™â€™Can I call to wish?â€™â€™ Her reply made me cry.

      I donâ€™t know what mistake I made.. I was running in tears for the whole day
      and still am.. But I didnâ€™t show it to her.. Because I feel Love is all
      about making the girl happy, not showing her that I am disturbed or sad
      because of her.
      <br /><br />So,
      <br />My Love is very simple.. Until she gets into love with someone she
      likes or gets engaged, I will be caring for her, and if she needs anything,
      I will get it for her. ðŸ™‚  ðŸ˜¦
      <br />
      Happy Diwali!!
