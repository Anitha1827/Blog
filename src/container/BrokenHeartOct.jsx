    i dono what mistake i made.. i was running in tears for the whole and still.. But i didn’t show to her.. Bcoz, i feel Love is all about making the girl happy, not showing her that i am disturbed  or sad bcoz of you.
    <br /><br />So,
    <br />My Love is very simple.. Till she get into love with someone she like or engaged, i will be caring her,and if she needs anything,i will get that to her. 🙂  😦

    Happy  Diwali!!
