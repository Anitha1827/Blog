        It’s been a month since I stopped talking to my so-called “close
        friends.” Literally, I was dead inside once again. In a difficult
        situation, no one came for help. But, I was there for them at all times.
        I was angry at them.
        <br />
        Later,
        <br />
        <br />
        I understood, the mistake was not on them. It’s me. I am not a normal
        person. In the sense, caring so much for everything.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even in my conversation with princess, I had NOT EVEN MESSAGED her like
        others. Very formal, very strict, looking for grammar mistakes. I hate
        myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        Everything for good. If I had married princess, she would have felt
        this. I am not a marriage material person. As I would always say, she is
        brilliant.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even in my college days, I had no friends. Same in school. Same in my
        workplace.
        <br />
        <br />
        People who approach me either come for help which I can only provide
        (like a machine or PC) or they come if they get bored and need a person
        who can buy them drinks or anything.
        <br />
        <br />I realized this about myself.
