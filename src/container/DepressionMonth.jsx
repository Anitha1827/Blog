        Its been a month i had stopped talking to my so called ” close friends
        “. Literally i was dead inside once again. In a difficult situation, no
        one came for help. But, i was there for them at all times. I was angry
        at them.
        <br />
        Later, <br />
        <br />
        i understood, mistake not on them. Its me. I am not a normal person. In
        the sense, caring so much for everything.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even in my conversation with princess, i had NOT EVEN MESSAGED her like
        others. Very formal, Very strict, looking for grammar mistakes. Hate
        myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        Everything for good. If at all, if i had married princess, she would
        have felt this. I am not a marriage material person. As i would have
        always say, she is brilliant.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even in my college days, i had no friends. Same in school. Same in my
        workplace.
        <br />
        <br />
        People who approach me, either come for an help which i can only do (
        like a machine or PC ) or they will come if they get bored and need a
        person who can buy them drinks or anything.
        <br />
        <br />I realized myself.
