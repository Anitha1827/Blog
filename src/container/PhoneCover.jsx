        Intake of Alcohol risen up. Previously, 1 Beer enough to become high,
        Now, 2 or 3 Minimum. Weird thing is, i started to cry immediately after
        2nd beer. Dono what is happening.
        <br />
        Ready stocks of Beer/GIN are kept in car as a reserve. Previously, my
        car will be absolute Neat. Now its turned as ” Moving BAR”
        <br />
        Spoiling my health sometimes makes me happy, in a way it can be helpful
        to death.
        <br />
        Messages from her totally stopped. She is no more seeing my whatsapp
        status. I cry for that. When she comes online, At late night, i use to
        keep ” Good Night ” DP in my whatsapp. Indirect way of messaging her
        like ” Please sleep and good Night”. She will be online, i dono whether
        she saw or not.
        <br />
        I too stopped messaging her, since i dono in what situation she is or
        what kind of thinking she would be?
        <br />
        Only good thing is, Im not Blocked. Every night before closing my eyes,
        after waking up, the VERY FIRST thing i do is check her whatsapp. If
        there is DP, i would think, huh!, im still unblocked.
        <br />
        Her previous birthday was not celebrated in a good way, in the sense, i
        was very much drunken. So, i did “Re-celebration” of birthday to my
        princess. Is there any Rule or How much times to celebrate? i will do
        “n” times.
