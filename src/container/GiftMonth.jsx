        I sent her ” Kandukonden Kandukoden ” song lyrics to her. Dono why i
        sent,but i thought she would like it. There is a particular line which i
        love in that song..
        <br />
        <br />
        “வெண்ணிலா வெளிச்சம் கிண்ணத்தில் விழுந்து நிறைந்தால் வழிந்தால் மகிழ்ச்சி
        <br />
        வெண்ணிலா வெளிச்சம் கிண்ணத்தை உடைத்தால் உயிரை உடைப்பாள் ஒருத்தி..”
        <br />
        2:16PM ( i cant forget this time )
        <br />
        I had ordered a NECKLACE for her, and ask her to receive it. She replied
        ..
        <br />” Please ,give to your wife ”
        <br />
        <br />
        😦 i was crying inside like anything.. I dono wat to do next.. i felt
        like everything is gone.. I cant able to understand her. Sometimes she
        reacts like there is love sometimes not.. And i am tired of dreaming on
        her reply..
        <br />
        <br />
        Tears rolling down… Cant able to stop it.. I just washed my face and
        asked leave in my office. My manager saw my face and said ” Are you Okay
        ” ?
        <br />
        <br />I just took my bike and went to home and closed my room… Tears!!
        Tears!!
        <br />
        <br />
        Dear, <br />
        <br />
        I see you as my WIFE only in my heart. Even though you reject my
        proposal 😥
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold"> MAY 3,2016 11:00AM</h1>
        <br />I disable the data connection in my mobile. I just feel that
        seeing her message or waiting for her message will affect me.I dono why
        i changed like this. Loving a girl truly have lot of pains.. I did not
        know this.
        <br />
        Her face is been running on my heart every second. I just control my
        tears wherever i go..
        <br />
        When she asked ” Please ,send the gift to your wife “, I thought of
        replying ” Yeah,i send it correctly only 🙂 ”
        <br />
        But i felt, at any situation i should not hurt her.. Not even a single
        message should make her uncomfortable or sad.. Becoz i feel she had
        enough of sadness she undergone, dont want to test her feelings anymore.
        <br />
        I remember a day,during my PHP Project, trainer scolded our team, except
        me everyone cried.. She had tears.. In that time, i just thought of
        hugging her tightly & say ” Dont cry please, its all right ”
        <br />
        I just don’t have talent to send romantic messages, flirt, speak.. All i
        can show my feeling & love only through my smile. But i realized its not
        enough 😦
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">MAY 4,2016 10:02AM</h1>
        <br />
        I made a severe mistake. I informed her that i will be deleting the
        watsapp, she got angry and switched off her data. I sent two sms saying
        ” sorry sorry,please,please come to watsapp”
        <br />
        She didn’t reply for any. Oh GOD!, I was very sad . AND, I SENT THIS
        BLOG LINK TO HER !!
        <br />
        Dono she read fully or not. But i am going to call her today and speak
        to her. Fact is, once she attend my call, i cant get any words to speak.
        <br />
        10:35AM, i sent a sms ” Can i call you “, No Reply from her 😦
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">10:50AM,</h1>
        <br />
        She replied ” Good Morning “. Was very happy, and asked sorry to her for
        saying ” I will delete the watsapp ”
        <br />
        I was happy and she became normal ( yet to confirm ), i decided that
        <br />
        ” Whatever it may be, if she is HAPPY only on me using watsapp, i
        think,i should not delete ”
        <br />
        But one day she will leave me or she will get married, on that day, i
        cant imagine the pain that i will undergo. But its Okay. 🙂 😥
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">MAY 6,2016 10:45PM</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        I need to hit myself first. I just messaged her like
        <br />
        <br />
        “Can i stop messaging you,as i feel you will leave me or stop messaging
        me. In order to get hurt on that time,its better to stop now itself as
        you clearly told that i am your WELL WISHER only ”
        <br />
        <br />
        She got upset. I was just calling her for job details, her voice was so
        dull and sad. I realized that i again made a mistake..Every time when i
        ask these questions,i’m indirectly hurting her. Sorry 😦
        <br />
        But, i dono how to take this. Like, If she had love, but she is not
        expressing it or suddenly asking me to be a dearest friend. And i am
        kind of boy who expect to be straight forward.
        <br />
        <br />
        But, its okay,she is my princess, and i need to bear all the sweet
        things she do it for me 🙂
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">6:01PM</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        She was online in watsapp, but didn’t reply to any messages. I still get
        confused. I dono she likes me or not. I can understand girls wont tell
        anything frankly, but.. 😦
        <br />
        Waiting….
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">9:15PM</h1>
        <br />I just again messaged her briefly

        <br />
        She ” didnt reply anything, instead she asked me not to delete watsapp.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">MAY 7,2016</h1>
        <br />I asked her to reply for the questions of what i asked, she said ”
        For ? “
        <br />
        Then she again started to ask ” DiD u had breakfast ?, Are u in office ?
        ” 😦
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold">6:56PM</span>
        <br />
        and she confirmed that ” THERE IS NO LOVE TOWARDS ME ” 🙂 I just got
        little tears but, its okay, God had decided she deserve someone better
        than me . And i should NOT disturb that.
        <br />
        Few advice for my Dear,
        <br />
        <br />I sincerely pray that you should get a person better than me & i
        know GOD wont disappoint me.
        <br />
        <br />
        1.Control your anger. I know you get anger for right things…but try.
        <br />
        2.If your aunt scold,just listen to her. Dont get upset,becoz relations
        are very important for you.
        <br />
        3.Before u get married to sweet person, make sure that u look after your
        sister to a better position. Dont make ure sister as burden for your
        mom. Try to get a job ( ill try for you )
        <br />
        4.And thats it.. i dont have words to say.. your place in my heart will
        stay forever. Take care dear.
        <br />
        <br />
        Well, its END.. Not for this page but, its the END of my conversation to
        her.
        <br />
        <br />
        From onwards, i will share how i feel without her ……. 🙂

        So, i just watch movies daily every night.. But even in movies, im
        seeing Malayalam movies. Becoz, i feel happy when seeing kerala..
        <br />
        <br />
        She messaged me to delete the website.
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">11:47AM,</h1>
        <br />I got a call from OVERSEAS Company. They said they have a vacancy
        in Singapore for a good salary. Actually i applied for this job after
        proposing her. So when i receive this call i dont know how to react.
        Becoz i was sad that,the main purpose of to get a job is NOT NO MORE 🙂
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">MAY 17,2016</h1>
        <br />
        She received my gift.. Finally. I was the happiest person in the
        world!!! I was happy becoz not that i impressed her or anything.. I was
        happy that, something she will have remembering me. 🙂
        <br />

        <br />
        I sent her this becoz, when she looks this pendant, She should feel she
        is independent, happy,decide things of her wish…!
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">MAY 18,2016</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        I told that i will call her on saturday ( Well,wont propose her ) to
        convey few things.. I am writing that in a paper.. This will be my last
        call to her.Becoz, i dont want to make her hurt or get confused. I asked
        her permission of 1Hour.. and very sweetly SHE SAID ” YES ” 🙂 was very
        happy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="font-bold">MAY 27,2016</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        As per her previous reply,i tried to call her. Before that i thought of
        asking her permission once again to make sure that she is ok. But she
        didnt reply. She was in travel.. And next day,she told not to call.. I
        was really upset for the whole day.
