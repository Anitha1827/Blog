    I sent her ” Kandukonden Kandukoden ” song lyrics to her. Dono why i
    sent,but i thought she would like it. There is a particular line which i
    love in that song..
    <br />
    <br />
    “வெண்ணிலா வெளிச்சம் கிண்ணத்தில் விழுந்து நிறைந்தால் வழிந்தால் மகிழ்ச்சி
    <br />
    வெண்ணிலா வெளிச்சம் கிண்ணத்தை உடைத்தால் உயிரை உடைப்பாள் ஒருத்தி..”
    <br />
    2:16PM ( i cant forget this time )
    <br />
    I had ordered a NECKLACE for her, and ask her to receive it. She replied
    ..
    <br />” Please ,give to your wife ”
    <br />
    <br />
    😦 i was crying inside like anything.. I dono wat to do next.. i felt
    like everything is gone.. I cant able to understand her. Sometimes she
    reacts like there is love sometimes not.. And i am tired of dreaming on
    her reply..
    <br />
    <br />
    Tears rolling down… Cant able to stop it.. I just washed my face and
    asked leave in my office. My manager saw my face and said ” Are you Okay
    ” ?
    <br />
    <br />I just took my bike and went to home and closed my room… Tears!!
    Tears!!
    <br />
    <br />
    Dear, <br />
    <br />
    I see you as my WIFE only in my heart. Even though you reject my
    proposal 😥
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 className="font-bold">MAY 3,2016 11:00AM</h1>
    <br />I disable the data connection in my mobile. I just feel that
    seeing her message or waiting for her message will affect me.I dono why
    i changed like this. Loving a girl truly have lot of pains.. I did not
    know this.
    <br />
    Her face is been running on my heart every second. I just control my
    tears wherever i go..
    <br />
    When she asked ” Please ,send the gift to your wife “, I thought of
    replying ” Yeah,i send it correctly only 🙂 ”
    <br />
    But i felt, at any situation i should not hurt her.. Not even a single
    message should make her uncomfortable or sad.. Becoz i feel she had
    enough of sadness she undergone, dont want to test her feelings anymore.
    <br />
    I remember a day,during my PHP Project, trainer scolded our team, except
    me everyone cried.. She had tears.. In that time, i just thought of
    hugging her tightly & say ” Dont cry please, its all right ”
    <br />
    I just don’t have talent to send romantic messages, flirt, speak.. All i
    can show my feeling & love only through my smile. But i realized its not
    enough 😦
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 className="font-bold">MAY 4,2016 10:02AM</h1>
    <br />
    I made a severe mistake. I informed her that i will be deleting the
    watsapp, she got angry and switched off her data. I sent two sms saying
    ” sorry sorry,please,please come to watsapp”
    <br />
    She didn’t reply for any. Oh GOD!, I was very sad . AND, I SENT THIS
    BLOG LINK TO HER !!
    <br />
    Dono she read fully or not. But i am going to call her today and speak
    to her. Fact is, once she attend my call, i cant get any words to speak.
    <br />
    10:35AM, i sent a sms ” Can i call you “, No Reply from her 😦
    <br />
    <h1 className="font-bold">10:50AM,</h1>
    <br />
    She replied ” Good Morning “. Was very happy, and asked sorry to her for
    saying ” I will delete the watsapp ”
    <br />
    I was happy and she became normal ( yet to confirm ), i decided that
    <br />
    ” Whatever it may be, if she is HAPPY only on me using watsapp, i
    think,i should not delete ”
    <br />
    But one day she will leave me or she will get married, on that day, i
    cant imagine the pain that i will undergo. But its Okay. 🙂 😥
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 className="font-bold">MAY 6,2016 10:45PM</h1>
    <br />
    <br />
    I need to hit myself first. I just messaged her like
    <br />
    <br />
    “Can i stop messaging you,as i feel you will leave me or stop messaging
    me. In order to get hurt on that time,its better to stop now itself as
    you clearly told that i am your WELL WISHER only ”
    <br />
    <br />
    She got upset. I was just calling her for job details, her voice was so
    dull and sad. I realized that i again made a mistake..Every time when i
    ask these questions,i’m indirectly hurting her. Sorry 😭
    <br />
    But, i dono how to take this. Like, If she had love, but she is not
    expressing it or suddenly asking me to be a dearest friend. And i am
    kind of boy who expect to be straight forward.
    <br />
    <br />
    But, its okay,she is my princess, and i need to bear all the sweet
    things she do it for me 🙂
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1 className="font-bold">6:01PM</h1>
    <br />
    <br />
    She was online in watsapp, but didn’t reply to any messages. I still get
    confused. I dono she likes me or not. I can understand girls wont tell
    anything frankly, but.. 😦
    <br />
    Waiting….
    <br />
    <h1 className="font-bold">9:15PM</h1>
    <br />I just again messaged her briefly
